This is the code-base for the Bachelor's Thesis on topic: "Analysis of Dynamics on Scale-free Network". In this work the scale-free networks are analysed under the dynamics represented by Kuramoto oscilators. For more details please refer to PDF-overviews of the work.

## Implementation

C++ - for dynamics calculation
C# - for UI and visualization

Scale-free networks are generated using static modification of Bollobás–Riordan model together with LCD-diagram.

Runge Kutta 4th Order method is used for solving differential equations.
